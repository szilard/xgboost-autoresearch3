## One Run Is Not Enough: How Much AI Agent Results Vary in Data Science, an XGBoost Optimization Study

#### by Szilard Pafka and Eduardo Ariño de la Rubia

**TL;DR** We used AI agents powered by three different large language models (LLMs) to autonomously tune an XGBoost model, running each LLM 20 times with the same setup and the same instructions. Every run improves the starting model, and on average the three LLMs rank clearly against one another. But results vary a lot from run to run, so much that the ranges of the different LLMs overlap. One run of a given setup is therefore not enough, either to judge how well an agent performs or to compare LLMs.
